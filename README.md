## Getting Started

1. **Installation**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required dependencies by running:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Start the game by running:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Objective**:
   - Observe and interact with a simulation of animals such as rabbits, foxes, and wolves in a dynamically evolving ecosystem.

## Game Controls

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how to control the simulation:

### Step-by-Step Simulation
- **Key**: Press `SPACE`
- **What It Does**: Advances the simulation by **one step**, during which:
  - Animals **move** to a new position based on their behavior and environment.
  - Predators like foxes and wolves may **hunt** nearby prey (e.g., rabbits).
  - Animals consume resources (e.g., food) and their **health** updates accordingly.
  - Reproductive events or population changes may occur depending on environmental factors.

### Continuous Simulation
- **Key**: Press `ENTER`
- **What It Does**: Runs the simulation **continuously** in real-time, where:
  - The ecosystem evolves without user intervention.
  - You can observe interactions like hunting, movement, and population dynamics seamlessly.
  - Animals will continue to move, eat, and reproduce until stopped.
- **Stop Continuous Simulation**: Press `ENTER` again to pause the simulation.

### Other Controls
- **Reset Simulation**: Press `R` to reset the game to its initial state.
- **Exit Game**: Press `ESC` to close the game.

## What Happens in the Simulation

Hereâ€™s what you can expect during gameplay:

- **Animal Movement**:
  - Rabbits move randomly to find food and avoid predators.
  - Foxes and wolves hunt prey, using strategic movements.
- **Hunting & Survival**:
  - Predators hunt nearby prey based on proximity and energy levels.
  - Prey animals may escape based on speed and surroundings.
- **Reproduction**:
  - Animals reproduce when conditions are favorable (e.g., sufficient food and health).
- **Population Dynamics**:
  - Watch as populations rise and fall based on the balance of predators and prey.

## In-Game Tooltips

To assist new players, weâ€™ve added **in-game tooltips**:
- When you start the game, a popup explains the controls.
- Tooltips display instructions like:
  - **"Press SPACE to advance the simulation step-by-step."**
  - **"Press ENTER to run the simulation continuously."**

## Additional Resources

- **Video/GIF Demonstration**: Check out our [demo video](#) to see the simulation in action!
- **FAQs**:
  - What is a simulation step?
    - A single moment in time where animals act based on their programmed behaviors.
  - How do I stop a continuous simulation?
    - Press `ENTER` again to pause.
