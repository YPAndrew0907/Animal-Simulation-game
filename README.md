# Nature Simulation v1

## Introduction
Welcome to Nature Simulation v1, an immersive ecosystem simulation game. Experience the thrill of a dynamic ecosystem, where the balance of life unfolds before your eyes. Watch as rabbits, foxes, and wolves interact in a world filled with trees and survival challenges.

## Features
- **Dynamic Ecosystem**: Experience the life cycle of flora and fauna, each with unique characteristics and survival needs.
- **Interactive Simulation Control**: Take control of the simulation with simple keystrokes, allowing you to step through the simulation or run it continuously.
- **Beautiful Visualisation**: Immerse yourself in a beautifully animated world, where every movement and interaction is meticulously rendered for a mesmerizing visual experience.

## Getting Started
1. **Installation**
    - Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed.
    - Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Running the Simulation**
    - Navigate to the downloaded directory.
    - Run the simulation using the following command:
      ```
      python main.py
      ```

## Controls
- `<SPACE>`: Run one step of the simulation.
- `<ARROW UP>`: Run the simulation continuously.

## Modules
- `main.py`: The entry point of the game, handling the game loop and events.
- `simulation.py`: Contains the logic for the ecosystem, including entity behaviors and interactions.
- `settings.py`: Defines the settings, constants, and configurations for the game.
